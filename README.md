# Health_insurance_priority_order_prediction
Machine learning model for predicting health insurance claims distribution on priority ordering using random forest classification. We work on the given dataset and then give our desired priority order and the model gives the output of .csv file with the priority order list prepared.

Future Scope : To add a frontend and backend for the model which would accept the individual input and then display the severity or urgency on the matter of when the claim should be settled.
